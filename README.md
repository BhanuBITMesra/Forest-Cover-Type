# Forest-Cover-Type
In this project, we want to use a variety of algorithms and classifiers to predict the type of tree cover in a sample area within Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado given various other features about the area, including the soil type, the vertical and horizontal distance to hydrology, the elevation, etc.
